Geology
Chennai is classified as being in Seismic Zone III, indicating a moderate risk of damage from earthquakes.[106] Owing to the geotectonic zone the city falls in, the city is considered a potential geothermal energy site. The crust has granite rocks indicating volcanic activities in the past. It is expected that temperatures of around 200 to 300 CÂ° will be available if the ground were drilled 4 to 5 km deep. The region has the oldest rocks in the country dating back to nearly a billion years.[107]

The southern stretch of Chennai's coast from Tiruvanmiyur to Neelangarai are favoured by the endangered olive ridley sea turtles to lay eggs every winter. A large number of cattle egrets, pond herons and other waterbirds can be seen in the rivers of Cooum and Adyar. About 75,000 birds migrate to Chennai every year.[108] Marshy wetlands such as Pallikaranai also play host to a number of migratorry birds during the monsoon and winter.[109] Over 300 species of birds have been recorrded in the city and its neighbourhood by members of Madras Naturalists' Society since its inception in 1978.
